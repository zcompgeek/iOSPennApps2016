//: ## Tuples
//:
//: Use a tuple to make a compound value—for example, to return multiple values from a function. The elements of a tuple can be referred to either by name or by number.
func calculateStatistics(scores: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int, sum: Int) {
    var min = scores[0]

//: ## While/Repeat
//:
//: Use `while` to repeat a block of code until a condition changes. The condition of a loop can be at the end instead, ensuring that the loop is run at least once.
//:
var n = 2
while n < 100 {
    n = n * 2
}
print(n)

var m = 2
repeat {
    m = m * 2
} while m < 100
print(m)

//: ## Range
//: You can keep an index in a loop by using `..<` to make a range of indexes.
//:
var total = 0
for i in 0..<4 {
    total += i
}
print(total)

//: Use `..<` to make a range that omits its upper value, and use `...` to make a range that includes both values.
//:
let closedRange = (0...5).maxElement()
let halfOpenRange = (0..<5).maxElement()
//: ## Variable arguments
//: Functions can also take a variable number of arguments, collecting them into an array.
//:
func sumOf(numbers: Int...) -> Int {
    var sum = 0
    for number in numbers {
        sum += number
    }
    return sum
