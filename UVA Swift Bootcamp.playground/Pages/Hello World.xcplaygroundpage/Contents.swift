//: [Previous](@previous) | [Next](@next)
//: # Hello, world!
//: Tradition suggests that the first program in a new language should print the words “Hello, world!” on the screen. In Swift, this can be done in a single line:
print("Hello, world!")
//: Code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program, so you don’t need a `main()` function. You also don’t need to write semicolons at the end of every statement.

//: [Previous](@previous) | [Next](@next)
